# js-video-audio-recording
Javascript multimedia booth to record Audio and Video and Picture  from GetUserMedia and MediaRecorder APIs 

When dealing with recording on Javascript side, this can rapidly become a nightmare (lots of unfinished ressources and APIs changing rapidely). I made this single FUNCTIONS SET to share my implementation of a Booth which can take Photo, Record Videos or Record Audio file natively from your browser and webcam. 

Enjoy it.
